## Exercises

Best to check the book to see the exercises: <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto#exercises>

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 5
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 6
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Tables

2.  Using the visual editor, insert a code chunk using the Insert menu and then the insert anything tool.

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

3.  Using the visual editor, figure out how to:
    a.  Add a footnote.

    b.  Add a horizontal rule.

    c.  Add a block quote.

click the footnote number in visual mode to see it[^1]

[^1]: This is a footnote

Horizontal rule added below

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow!

> \>Format
>
> Now from the drop down select \>Blockquote

4.  In the visual editor, go to Insert \> Citation and insert a citation to the paper titled [Welcome to the Tidyverse](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01686) using its DOI (digital object identifier), which is [10.21105/joss.01686](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01686). Render the document and observe how the reference shows up in the document. What change do you observe in the YAML of your document?

The YAML now has an added argument `bibliography: references.bib`\

1.  Using the source editor and the Markdown quick reference, figure out how to:

    a.  Add a footnote.

    b.  Add a horizontal rule.

    c.  Add a block quote.

Footnote[^2]

[^2]: This is a footnote created within source

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> This is a block quote
>
> It's easy to make one in source

2.  Copy and paste the contents of `diamond-sizes.qmd` from <https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/tree/main/quarto> in to a local R Quarto document. Check that you can run it, then add text after the frequency polygon that describes its most striking features.
3.  Create a document in a Google doc or MS Word (or locate a document you have created previously) with some content in it such as headings, hyperlinks, formatted text, etc. Copy the contents of this document and paste it into a Quarto document in the visual editor. Then, switch over to the source editor and inspect the source code.

I copied and pasted my CV within the visual editor and when rendering back to a Word document the format wasn't exactly the same. In particular it seemed like bullet points were messing up the format when trying to re-render the document.
