## Dates and times - Creating date/times

1. What happens if you parse a string that contains invalid dates?

```{r Invalid dates}
ymd(c("2010-10-10", "bananas"))
# Warning:  1 failed to parse.[1] "2010-10-10" NA   
```

2. What does the tzone argument to today() do? Why is it important?

```{r Tzone argument}
today(tzone = "GMT") # UK time zone
today(tzone = "EST") # US time zone

# The tzone argument is self-explanatory. Its important as somebody in China using the `today` function at the exact same time as myself (UK) might end up having a different day presented than myself
```

3. For each of the following date-times, show how you’d parse it using a readr column specification and a lubridate function.

```{r Parsing date times}
d1 <- "January 1, 2010"
d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
d4 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
d5 <- "12/30/14" # Dec 30, 2014
t1 <- "1705"
t2 <- "11:15:10.12 PM"

mdy(d1)
parse_date(d1, "%B %d, %Y")
ymd(d2)
parse_date(d2, "%Y-%b-%D")
dmy(d3)
parse_date(d3, "%D-%b-%Y")
mdy(d4)
parse_date(d4, "%B %d (%Y)")
mdy(d5)
parse_date(d5, "%m/%d/%y")
# Much easier to not using lubridate for the following time
parse_time(t1, "%H%M")
hms(t2)
parse_time(t2, "%I:%M:%OS %p")
```

## Dates and times - Date-time components

```{r Exercise setup}
# Use the following for the following questions:
make_datetime_100 <- function(year, month, day, time) {
  make_datetime(year, month, day, time %/% 100, time %% 100)
}

flights_dt <- flights |> 
  filter(!is.na(dep_time), !is.na(arr_time)) |> 
  mutate(
    dep_time = make_datetime_100(year, month, day, dep_time),
    arr_time = make_datetime_100(year, month, day, arr_time),
    sched_dep_time = make_datetime_100(year, month, day, sched_dep_time),
    sched_arr_time = make_datetime_100(year, month, day, sched_arr_time)
  ) |> 
  select(origin, dest, ends_with("delay"), ends_with("time"))

flights_dt
```

1. How does the distribution of flight times within a day change over the course of the year?

```{r Day flight times over course of a year}
flights_dt |> 
  mutate(day = yday(dep_time)) |> 
  group_by(day) |> 
  mutate(
    avg_delay = mean(air_time, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
    ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = avg_delay)) +
  geom_line()
# Seems to be a downwards trend through the start of the year to pre-holiday months, then a sharp increase especially in the Christmas period
```

2. Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time and dep_delay. Are they consistent? Explain your findings.

Answer: They would be consistent if sched_dep_time - dep_time = dep_delay

```{r Inconsistent timings}
flights_dt |> 
  count(consistent = (sched_dep_time - dep_time) == (dep_delay))
# We can see this is not the case for the majority of the timings, likely due to some natural human error where there will always be a few seconds off.
```

3. Compare air_time with the duration between the departure and arrival. Explain your findings. (Hint: consider the location of the airport.)

Answer: Similar to the above we should expect the arrival time minus departure time to equal total air time

```{r Consistent with departure and arrival?}
flights_dt |> 
  count(consistent = (arr_time - dep_time) == (air_time))
# Again vast majority of the flights are FALSE, only a couple hundred are TRUE and some are NA likely due to cancelled flights.

flights_dt |> 
  mutate(consistent = (arr_time - dep_time) == (air_time)) |> 
  relocate(origin, dest, dep_time, arr_time, air_time, consistent) |> 
  filter(consistent == TRUE) |> 
  count(origin, dest)
# I can't seem to find much pattern. Check transform.Rmd for a better explanation

```

4. How does the average delay time change over the course of a day? Should you use dep_time or sched_dep_time? Why?

Answer: We should use scheduled departure times as this is what passengers will be using to know approximately when they should be arriving for their flight. As a passenger it would be useful to see what scheduled departure times have the highest delays in time so that you could plan better (Perhaps getting a flight at a less delayed time).

```{r Average delay over the day}
flights_dt |> 
  mutate(hour = hour(sched_dep_time)) |> 
  group_by(hour) |> 
  summarize(
    avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = avg_delay)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
# It steadily increases from 5 in the morning to about 7 in the evening, stagnates till 9 then sharply decreases as most of the days congestion is clearing at these late times
```

5. On what day of the week should you leave if you want to minimise the chance of a delay?

```{r Best week day}
flights_dt |> 
  mutate(wday = wday(sched_dep_time, label = TRUE)) |> 
  mutate(wday = factor(wday, levels = c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"))) |> 
  group_by(wday) |> 
  summarize(
    avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(wday, avg_delay)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity") +
  theme_bw()
# Best day of the week to leave is on a Saturday
```

6. What makes the distribution of diamonds$carat and flights$sched_dep_time similar?

```{r Distribution similarities}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_bar()

ggplot(flights, aes(x = sched_dep_time)) +
  geom_bar()
# There seems to be rounding to certain "nice" values that we like. For carats, its rounding to 1/3's or whole numbers. For sched_dep_time it appears, at a glance, that rounding happens to the nearest 30 minutes.
```

7. Confirm our hypothesis that the early departures of flights in minutes 20-30 and 50-60 are caused by scheduled flights that leave early. Hint: create a binary variable that tells you whether or not a flight was delayed.

```{r Early departures in nice "round" numbers}
# The plot this question is refering to:
flights_dt |> 
  mutate(minute = minute(dep_time)) |> 
  group_by(minute) |> 
  summarize(
    avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = avg_delay)) +
  geom_line()

flights_dt |> 
  mutate(
    minute = minute(dep_time),
    is_delay = (dep_delay > 0)
      ) |> 
  group_by(minute) |> 
  mutate(sum_delay = sum(is_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = sum_delay)) +
  geom_line()
# We can see similar behavior confirming our hypothesis. The total amount of delayed time is lower at times 20-30 and 40-60
```

## Dates and times - Time spans

Exercise setup at chunk 5 is necessary to run the following exercise's code

1. Explain days(!overnight) and days(overnight) to someone who has just started learning R. What is the key fact you need to know?

```{r Overnight and not overnight}
flights_dt <- flights_dt |> 
  mutate(
    overnight = arr_time < dep_time,
    arr_time = arr_time + days(overnight),
    sched_arr_time = sched_arr_time + days(overnight)
  )

# 'days(!overnight)` can be used to see how many days a flight that did not occur overnight had. In this case we should expect that all flights where `overnight == FALSE` should have a total of 0 days. Lets use the count function to see:

# Lets group by overnight first
flights_dt |> 
  group_by(overnight) |> 
  count(days(!overnight))

# Then not grouped
flights_dt |> 
  count(days(!overnight))

# We see based off the two above results, all flights that did not take place overnight have a total of zero days (as expected!)

# `days(overnight)` is a very similar argument but the opposite.
```

2. Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every month in 2015. Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every month in the current year.

```{r Vectors of dates}
# Lets try doing it this way
y2015 <- c(wday(ymd("2015-01-01")), wday(ymd("2015-02-01")), ...)

# Thats very repetitive. Lets use a sequence instead
dates_2015 <- seq(from = ymd("2015-01-01"), to = ymd("2015-12-01"), by = "1 month")
wkdays_2015 <- weekdays(dates_2015, abbreviate = FALSE)
wkdays_2015

dates_2023 <- seq(from = ymd("2023-01-01"), to = ymd("2023-12-01"), by = "1 month")
wkdays_2023 <- weekdays(dates_2023, abbreviate = FALSE)
wkdays_2023
```

3. Write a function that given your birthday (as a date), returns how old you are in years.

```{r How old am I?}
born <- ymd("2000-03-04")
age <- function(born){
  x <- today() - born
  as.duration(x)
}

age(born)
```

4. Why can’t (today() %--% (today() + years(1))) / months(1) work?

```{r Why doesn't this work?}
(today() %--% (today() + years(1))) / months(1, abbreviate = FALSE)
# Given how `years(1) / days(1)` works (i.e. it returns an average of 365.25 due to the fact leap years exist), then if you run the above code on a leap year we will get a double that is slightly higher than the value of 12. This is because the numerator is an interval while the denominator is a period which isn't always the same. Instead we should run:

(today() %--% (today() + years(1))) %/% months(1, abbreviate = FALSE)
```
