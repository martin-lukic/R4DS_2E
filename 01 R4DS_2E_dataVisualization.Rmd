## Data Visualization Exercises - First Steps

1. How many rows are in penguins? How many columns?

```{r rows/columns penguins}
nrow(penguins) # 344 rows total. i.e. 344 observations of penguins.
ncol(penguins) # 8 total columns. i.e. 8 total variables that we are measuring when looking at a penguin
```

2. What does the bill_depth_mm variable in the penguins data frame describe? Read the help for ?penguins to find out.

```{r bill_depth_mm}
?penguins # it seems self explanatory but lets look at the documentation.
# bill_depth_mm a number denoting bill depth (millimeters)
```

3. Make a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm. That is, make a scatterplot with bill_depth_mm on the y-axis and bill_length_mm on the x-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables.

```{r scatter bill_depth vs bill_length}
# Lets make a scatterplot similar to the one in the book.

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)
) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
# Making a very similar plot to the one in the notes it seems it isn't wise to have the loess curve go through each
# three different species, since they at first glance overall have no correlation.
```


```{r scatter bill_depth vs bill_length improved}
# Lets make a regression line go for each species separately

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species, shape = species)
) + # Change the mapping to the global mapping
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Bill length and bill depth (mm)",
       subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelle, Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins",
       x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Species", shape = "Species") +
  scale_colour_colorblind()
# Now we see there is a decently positive correlation between bill_length and bill_depth among the three different
# species
```

4. What happens if you make a scatterplot of species vs. bill_depth_mm? What might be a better choice of geom?

```{r scatter species vs bill_depth_mm}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = species)
) +
  geom_point()
# This isn't that good of a visualization since we have a categorical variable (Species)
# I think a better geom might be something like a boxplot so we can see the spread of bill_depth_mm between each
# species, mean etc.
```

```{r boxplot species vs bill_depth_mm}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = species)
) +
  geom_boxplot()
# We get more information out of this. Minimum, maximum, Lower quartile, upper quartile and the median etc. of each species
```

5. Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?

ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point()

```{r fixing error}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point()
# We get the following error message:
# Caused by error in `compute_geom_1()`:
# ! `geom_point()` requires the following missing aesthetics: x and y
# So we can fix this by simply adding an aesthetics for the x & y axis. Maybe we can do the following:

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```

6. What does the na.rm argument do in geom_point()? What is the default value of the argument? Create a scatterplot where you successfully use this argument set to TRUE.

na.rm argument removes any missing values or NA values when plotting each observation. The default value is set to FALSE and we get a warning saying we have certain missing values for some observations.

```{r na.rm TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
```

7. Add the following caption to the plot you made in the previous exercise: “Data come from the palmerpenguins package.” Hint: Take a look at the documentation for labs().

```{r labs caption}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(caption = "Data comes from the palmerpenguins package")
```

8. Recreate the following visualization. What aesthetic should bill_depth_mm be mapped to? And should it be mapped at the global level or at the geom level?

It looks like bill_depth_mm should be mapped to geom_point and not the global mapping within the ggplot function since there is a single smooth line through every possible bill_depth_mm value.

```{r visualization}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

9. Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.

ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
  
```{r What will happen?}
# It will map flipper_length_mm vs body_mass_g and separate them by colour according to the island the penguin resides. Since the colour argument is given in the global mapping, we will see a regression line for each possible island. Also `se = FALSE` so there won't be a confidence interval around each regression line.

ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
  
10. Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

```{r Two graphs}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
# The above code makes a scatterplot that maps body_mass_g vs flipper_length_mm of the penguins and also adds a regression line.

ggplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = penguins,
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = penguins,
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  )
# This above code I believe will also make the exact same plot since even though we haven't got any global mapping being passed to each geom function, for each individual geom function however the mapping are identical 
```

## Data Visualization Exercises - Visualizing distributions

1. Make a bar plot of species of penguins, where you assign species to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different?

```{r Bar plot species}
ggplot(penguins, aes(y = fct_infreq(species))) +
  geom_bar()

# This plot is different as its now horizontal. The count for each species is given in ascending order as seen by the smallest count on top (top to bottom)
```

2. How are the following two plots different? Which aesthetic, color or fill, is more useful for changing the color of bars?

```{r Two plots}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(color = "red")
# If you only use the color argument in `geom_bar` it adds a red line around each bar (Which isn't really the intended effect)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "red")
# So instead fill is much more useful for changing the colour of bars
```

3. What does the bins argument in geom_histogram() do?

```{r Bins argument}
# It should force the number of bins that we specify to the argument. Lets have a look with an example:
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15)
# Each bin is of equal width.
```

4. Make a histogram of the carat variable in the diamonds dataset that is available when you load the tidyverse package. Experiment with different binwidths. What binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns?

```{r Diamonds carat}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
# I would argue that binwidths greater than 0.1 obscure an interesting pattern in the data. Using `binwidth = 0.01`, we can see that there are large spikes at certain intervals. It appears when somebody calculates the carat of a diamond some sort of rounding is done. (Looks to be rounding to 1/3, 2/3, 1, etc.)
```

## Data Visualization Exercises - Visualizing relationships

1. The mpg data frame that is bundled with the ggplot2 package contains 234 observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 car models. Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are numerical? (Hint: Type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you see this information when you run mpg?

```{r Mpg overview}
?mpg # Looking at the documentation, certain variables should clearly be categorical such as manufacturer, model, class, etc.

mpg
# After looking at the dataset, we can get a sense of what variables are definetly categorical due to their type. For example variables with the type character (<chr>) by nature have to be categorical. This includes, manufacturer, model, trans, drv, fl, class. Some numerical variables such as cyl may be categorical despite being numerical (<int>) since they only take a small handful of values:

mpg |>
  count(cyl)
mpg |>
  count(year)
# So they only contain 4, 5, 6 and 8 cylinder vehicles. I would also consider cyl a categorical variable in this context. Also year only contains two values so again you may want to consider this as a categorical variable despite being numeric. Other numerical variables are displ, cty and hwy.
```

2. Make a scatterplot of hwy vs. displ using the mpg data frame. Next, map a third, numerical variable to color, then size, then both color and size, then shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. numerical variables?

```{r hwy vs. displ p1}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
# As the engine size increases, fuel economy decreases
```

```{r hwy vs. displ p2}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = cty)) +
  geom_point()
# When mapping a numerical variable, we get a sliding scale of colour.

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = year)) +
  geom_point()
# Interestingly this is also the case for a discrete numerical variable such as year.

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class)) +
  geom_point()
# This isn't the case for a categorical variable. We get distinct colours for each possible entry for class.
```

```{r hwy vs. displ p3}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = cty)) +
  geom_point()
# Using size, for a numerical variable we don't get a sliding scale of colour, instead it appears as though they are broken into different "buckets" (similar to the binwidth argument of a histogram)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class)) +
  geom_point()
# So in many ways a numerical and categorical variable act identically in terms of the size argument

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = cty, size = cty)) +
  geom_point()
# Due to this discrepancy with numerical variables, we have two seperate legends.
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class, size = class)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r hwy vs. displ p4}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = cty)) +
  geom_point()
# We get the error `! A continuous variable cannot be mapped to the shape aesthetic`

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) +
  geom_point()
# Standard expected behaviour of a categorical variable
```

3. In the scatterplot of hwy vs. displ, what happens if you map a third variable to linewidth?

```{r Linewidth}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linewidth = cty)) +
  geom_point()
# Since linewidth is not an aesthetic associated with the global mapping nor `geom_point`, we get the following warning, `Warning: Ignoring unknown aesthetics: linewidth`
```

4. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?

```{r Multiple aesthetics}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class, shape = class)) +
  geom_point()
# Mapping the same variable to multiple aesthetics is ultimately redundant. For the above plot, we can already tell which class is which by the size argument, there is no reason for the additional shape argument.
```

5. Make a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm and color the points by species. What does adding coloring by species reveal about the relationship between these two variables? What about faceting by species?

```{r Scatterplot bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_point()
# We see that although overall for the three species there doesn't appear to be a correlation between bill length and bill depth, when we colour out each species we now see that there may actually be some sort of correlation. Each species is distinct in there bill length and depth

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~species)
```

6. Why does the following yield two separate legends? How would you fix it to combine the two legends?

```{r Two separate legends}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, 
    color = species, shape = species
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "Species")
# When adding the `labs` function we only specified color when we also need to specify the same but for shape

ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, 
    color = species, shape = species
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "Species", shape = "Species")
```

7. Create the two following stacked bar plots. Which question can you answer with the first one? Which question can you answer with the second one?

```{r Stacked bar plots}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
# We can answer the proportion of each penguin species on each island. For example we can see that every single penguin on the island of Torgersen is from the Adelie species, etc.
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = island)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
# We can answer each island's proportion of species. For example, only Gentoo penguins reside on the island of Biscoe and only Chinstrap penguins reside on the island of Dream.
```

## Data Visualization Exercises - Saving your plots

1. Run the following lines of code. Which of the two plots is saved as mpg-plot.png? Why?

```{r Which one's saved?}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave("mpg-plot.png")
# The second plot will get saved to the current working directory due to it being the most recently run plot before using the `ggsave` function
```

2. What do you need to change in the code above to save the plot as a PDF instead of a PNG? How could you find out what types of image files would work in ggsave()?

```{r Save as PDF}
# We could look at the documentation to see how to save as PDF and what other types of image files work in ggsave
?ggsave
# device: Device to use. Can either be a device function (e.g. png), or one of "eps", "ps", "tex" (pictex), "pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", "svg" or "wmf" (windows only).
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave("mpg-plot", device = "pdf")
# I thought the above would save as a pdf document but it just saves as a `File type: File`?
# Instead we can just include the suffix of .pdf to our filename
ggsave("mpg-plot.pdf")
```
