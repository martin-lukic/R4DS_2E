## Hierarchical data - Unnesting

```{r Unnesting exercises setup}
df1 <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
  1, list(a = 11, b = 12),
  2, list(a = 21, b = 22),
  3, list(a = 31, b = 32),
)

df2 <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
  1, list(11, 12, 13),
  2, list(21),
  3, list(31, 32),
)
```

1. What happens when you use unnest_wider() with unnamed list-columns like df2? What argument is now necessary? What happens to missing values?

```{r Unnest wider on unnamed list-columns}
df2 |> 
  unnest_wider(y)
# The following error occurs:
#> Error in `unnest_wider()`:
#> ℹ In column: `y`.
#> ℹ In row: 1.
#> Caused by error:
#> ! Can't unnest elements with missing names.
#> ℹ Supply `names_sep` to generate automatic names.
# Hence we must supply a `names_sep` argument.

df2 |> 
  unnest_wider(y, names_sep = "_")
# Missing values are now given a respective missing value
```

2. What happens when you use unnest_longer() with named list-columns like df1? What additional information do you get in the output? How can you suppress that extra detail?

```{r Unnest longer with named list-columns}
df1 |> 
  unnest_longer(y)
# We get the y value along with the respective id value in a column called `y_id`

# Set `indices_include = FALSE` to exclude this extra detail
df1 |> 
  unnest_longer(y, indices_include = FALSE)
```

3. From time-to-time you encounter data frames with multiple list-columns with aligned values. For example, in the following data frame, the values of y and z are aligned (i.e. y and z will always have the same length within a row, and the first value of y corresponds to the first value of z). What happens if you apply two unnest_longer() calls to this data frame? How can you preserve the relationship between x and y? (Hint: carefully read the docs).

```{r Multiple list-columns with aligned values dataframe}
df4 <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  "a", list("y-a-1", "y-a-2"), list("z-a-1", "z-a-2"),
  "b", list("y-b-1", "y-b-2", "y-b-3"), list("z-b-1", "z-b-2", "z-b-3")
)

df4 |> 
  unnest_longer(y) |> 
  unnest_longer(z)

df4 |> 
  unnest_longer(c(y, z))
# I'm fairly certain that the above code preserves the relationship between x & y, this is because we supplied multiple columns, and values from the same row will be recycled to their common size (common size being three between y and z)
```

## Hierarchical data - Case studies

```{r gh_repos setup}
repos <- tibble(json = gh_repos)
repos <- repos |> 
  unnest_longer(json) |> 
  unnest_wider(json)
```

1. Roughly estimate when gh_repos was created. Why can you only roughly estimate the date?

Answer: According to the documentation: "A unnamed list with 6 components, each itself a list of 30 repos for a specific GitHub user. Each repo's component is a list of length >60, containing information such as name, owner (a list), fork status, and creation date." A possible way of estimating when gh_repos was created was by looking at the 'created_at' variable and finding the earliest possible time. (e.g. at `gh_repos[[1]][[1]][["created_at"]]`, so inside a specific GitHub user's "component")

```{r Estimating gh_repos creation date}
names(repos)
# Looking over the different variables, created_at, updated_at, and pushed_at are all relevant, with created_at being the most relevant.

repos_creation <- repos |> 
  select(created_at)
repos_creation

repos_creation |> 
  mutate(created_at = as.POSIXct(repos_creation$created_at, format = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")) |> 
  arrange(created_at)
# The earliest 'created_at' value dates back to 2012-06-24 14:36:20, so I estimate it was created at about this time. It's hard to tell when exactly it was created as I'm not sure which timezone its using for this column.
```

2. The owner column of gh_repo contains a lot of duplicated information because each owner can have many repos. Can you construct an owners data frame that contains one row for each owner? (Hint: does distinct() work with list-cols?)

```{r Getting all owners}
owners <- repos |> 
  select(id, full_name, owner, description) |> 
  unnest_wider(owner, names_sep = "_") |> 
  distinct(owner_login)

# Let's try `distinct` on the owners column when it's still a list-column
repos |> 
  select(id, full_name, owner, description) |>
  distinct(owner) |> 
  unnest_wider(owner)
# It actually works a little bit better than the above code since we get all the other relevant columns related to each owner.
```

```{r Game of Thrones data setup}
chars <- tibble(json = got_chars)
chars <- chars |> 
  unnest_wider(json)
chars
```

3. Follow the steps used for titles to create similar tables for the aliases, allegiances, books, and TV series for the Game of Thrones characters.

```{r Game of Thrones tables}
aliases <- chars |> 
  select(id, aliases) |> 
  unnest_longer(aliases) |> 
  filter(aliases != "") |> 
  rename(alias = aliases)

# Since this is pretty repetitive we could use a for loop, but we haven't seen how to do it as this stage in the second edition of the book

allegiances <- chars |> 
  select(id, allegiances) |> 
  unnest_longer(allegiances) |> 
  filter(allegiances != "") |> 
  rename(allegiance = allegiances)

books <- chars |> 
  select(id, books) |> 
  unnest_longer(books) |> 
  filter(books != "") |> 
  rename(book = books)

tvSeries <- chars |> 
  select(id, tvSeries) |> 
  unnest_longer(tvSeries) |> 
  filter(tvSeries != "") |> 
  rename(TV_Serie = tvSeries)

```

4. Explain the following code line-by-line. Why is it interesting? Why does it work for got_chars but might not work in general?

```{r Explain the following code}
tibble(json = got_chars) |> 
  unnest_wider(json) |> 
  select(id, where(is.list)) |> # Selects id column and all list columns.
  pivot_longer( # Now we pivot longer every list column 
    where(is.list), 
    names_to = "name", # names such as titles, aliases, allegiances etc. go to a new column
    values_to = "value" # The list values go to a column called value
  ) |>  
  unnest_longer(value) # Now we unnest this list-column
# So we get every column where a list-column existed in the original dataframe, with their respective values.
# Not every dataframe will have a full list-column (For example got_chars has lists where `<chr [1]>` which may just be a value for other dataframes, thus messing with the unnesting functions)
```

5. In gmaps_cities, what does address_components contain? Why does the length vary between rows? Unnest it appropriately to figure it out. (Hint: types always appears to contain two elements. Does unnest_wider() make it easier to work with than unnest_longer()?) .

```{r gmaps_cities overview}
# As always, use the `View` function to get a general overview of this dataframe, we can always copy the necessary code to find what we want.
View(gmaps_cities)
gmaps_cities[[2]][[1]][["results"]][[1]][["address_components"]]
# address_components contains the long and short name of a city or state and two types, one referring to what it is (For example the US is referred to as a country) the second is seemingly to do with politics as the only responses are "political". The length varies between rows as different cities/states will have a different number of related cities/states.

gmaps_cities |> 
  unnest_wider(json) |> 
  select(-status) |> 
  unnest_longer(results) |> 
  unnest_wider(results)
```

## Hierarchical data - JSON

1. Rectangle the df_col and df_row below. They represent the two ways of encoding a data frame in JSON.

```{r Rectangling JSON data}
json_col <- parse_json('
  {
    "x": ["a", "x", "z"],
    "y": [10, null, 3]
  }
')
json_row <- parse_json('
  [
    {"x": "a", "y": 10},
    {"x": "x", "y": null},
    {"x": "z", "y": 3}
  ]
')

df_col <- tibble(json = list(json_col)) 
df_row <- tibble(json = json_row)

df_col |> 
  unnest_wider(json) |> 
  unnest_longer(c(x, y))

df_row |> 
  unnest(json)
```
