## Transform - Creating a string

1. Create strings that contain the following values:

 - He said "That's amazing!"
 - \a\b\c\d
 - \\\\\\

```{r Creating strings}
string1 <- "He said \"That's amazing!\""
str_view(string1)
string2 <- "\\a\\b\\c\\d"
str_view(string2)
string3 <- "\\\\\\\\\\\\"
str_view(string3)
```

2. Create the string in your R session and print it. What happens to the special “\u00a0”? How does str_view() display it? Can you do a little googling to figure out what this special character is?

```{r Strange special character}
x <- "This\u00a0is\u00a0tricky"
str_view(x)
# Seems to just put the literal unicode but in curly brackets. After googling it appears to be the special invisible character (much like a spacebar stroke but not the exact same)

```

## Transform - Creating many strings from data

1. Compare and contrast the results of paste0() with str_c() for the following inputs:

```{r paste0 vs str_c}
str_c("hi ", NA) # [1] NA
str_c(letters[1:2], letters[1:3]) # Creates an error as it can't recycle a size 2 vector with a size 3 one
paste0("hi ", NA) # paste0 doesn't follow the rules about missing values which can be seen as a negative
paste0(letters[1:2], letters[1:3]) # It matches aa, bb, and then the first size 2 vector is "recycled" and a matches with c to produce ac
```

2. What’s the difference between paste() and paste0()? How can you recreate the equivalent of paste() with str_c()?

```{r paste and paste0 difference}
paste0("hi ", "world")
paste("hi ", "world") # paste automatically adds a space between each string, paste0 doesn't

# str_c has a separator argument. For paste to be equivalent to str_c we need to do `sep = " "`. This still doesn't work exactly the same is we have a missing value and I'm not sure how to remedy this
str_c("hi ", "world", sep = " ")
paste("hi ", "world")
```

3. Convert the following expressions from str_c() to str_glue() or vice versa:

```{r Concatenate to glue or vice versa}
food = "chocolate"
price = "£5"
str_c("The price of ", food, " is ", price)
str_glue("The price of {food} is {price}")

age = 23
country = "England"
str_glue("I'm {age} years old and live in {country}")
str_c("I'm ", age, " years old and live in ", country)

title = "Lord of the Rings"
str_c("\\section{", title, "}")
str_glue("\\\\section{{{title}}}")
# Remember that with glue you adding special characters we double up that special character.
```

## Transform - Letters

1. When computing the distribution of the length of babynames, why did we use wt = n?

```{r Why did we use wt?}
# babynames has its owns column called n which tells us how many people in this dataset have the name Mary for example. Therefore, we have to use `wt = n` to add up all these values to get an accurate depiction of how many people have name lengths of 2, 3, etc.
babynames

babynames |>
  count(length = str_length(name))
# Note how the n column is specified in the wt argument so its not relevant in computing n in the above

babynames |>
  count(length = str_length(name), wt = n)
```

2. Use str_length() and str_sub() to extract the middle letter from each baby name. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters?

```{r middle letter}
# I'm choosing to include the middle two letters if the string has an even number of characters
example <- c("Martin", "Lukic", "1", "")
str_sub(example, 
        if_else(str_length(example) %% 2 == 0, 
           str_length(example) / 2, 
           ceiling(str_length(example) / 2)),
        if_else(str_length(example) %% 2 == 0, 
           (str_length(example) / 2) + 1, 
           ceiling(str_length(example) / 2))
        )

```

3. Are there any major trends in the length of babynames over time? What about the popularity of first and last letters?

```{r Trends of babynames p1}
babynames |>
  group_by(year) |> 
  count(length = str_length(name), wt = n) |> 
  mutate(length = as.character(length)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(year, n, colour = length)) +
  geom_point()
# We see that very large names stay relatively the same throughout the years. Interestingly between the years 1880-1910 there is a much more "even" spread in terms of the counts of lengths of babynames. Then after this point, names of length 5,6 and 7 shoot up, then temper and reduce abit, then shoot back in post 1940, again drop off post 1960 then are steadily rising once more. We should probably look at this graph but with proportions of babynames instead as the count may be obfuscating the larger length babynames.
```

```{r Trends of babynames p2}
babynames |>
  group_by(year) |> 
  count(length = str_length(name), wt = prop) |> 
  mutate(length = as.character(length)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(year, n, colour = length)) +
  geom_point()
# Now we get a little bit of a different picture. Large length babynames are again relatively the same apart from there seems to be a spikes in length 11-12 babynames during ~1970-1990. The main different is we see that names of length, 5 and 6 dont proportionally change much compared to the actual count increase. Length 4 babynames also show a decrease overtime proportionally. The only length that has a general increase overtime is 7 length babynames
```

```{r Trends of babynames p3}
# Very messy due to the entire alphabet being displayed in the legend, and hard to distinguish between different letters. I think I'll group them by vowels and consonants.
babynames |> 
  mutate(
    first = str_sub(name, 1, 1),
    last = str_sub(name, -1, -1),
    is_vowel = str_detect(first, "[AEIOU]")
  ) |> 
  group_by(year, is_vowel) |> 
  count(is_vowel, wt = prop) |> 
  ggplot(aes(year, n, colour = is_vowel)) +
  geom_point()

# The proportion doesn't seem to add up to 1 for some weird reason. So instead I'm going to use count
babynames |> 
  mutate(
    first = str_sub(name, 1, 1),
    last = str_sub(name, -1, -1),
    is_vowel = str_detect(first, "[AEIOU]")
  ) |> 
  group_by(year, is_vowel) |> 
  count(is_vowel, wt = n) |> 
  ggplot(aes(year, n, colour = is_vowel)) +
  geom_point()
# We see a sharper increase in names that start with a consonant than a vowel. We also see a generally more constant increase in names that start with a vowel than those that don't
```
