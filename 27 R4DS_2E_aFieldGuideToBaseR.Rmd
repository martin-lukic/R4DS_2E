## A field guide to base R - Selecting multiple elements with [

1.  Create functions that take a vector as input and return:

The elements at even-numbered positions. Every element except the last value. Only even values (and no missing values).

```{r Elements at even-numbered positions}
x <- c(1, 5, 2, 3, 6)

even_pos <- function(x) {
  x[seq(from = 2, to = length(x), by = 2)]
}

even_pos(x)
```

```{r No last value}
x <- c(1, 1, 1, 5)

no_last <- function(x) {
  x[-length(x)]
}

no_last(x)
```

```{r Only even values and no missing values}
x <- c(1, 1, 2, 1, 4, NA, 4, 1, NA, 2)

even_vals <- function(x) {
  x[(x %% 2 == 0) & !is.na(x)]
}

even_vals(x)
```

2.  Why is x[-which(x \> 0)] not the same as x[x \<= 0]? Read the documentation for which() and do some experiments to figure it out.

```{r Experimenting with which}
x <- c(-Inf, NaN, 5, 1, -5, -100, 0, NA, Inf)

x[-which(x > 0)]
x[x <= 0]

# Only difference I can really see is that `which` does not change the typing of NaN values (i.e. Not a Number)
```

## A field guide to base R - Selecting a single element with \$ and [[

1.  What happens when you use [[ with a positive integer that's bigger than the length of the vector? What happens when you subset with a name that doesn't exist?

```{r Base subsetting behaviour}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(y1 = 1, y2 = 2, y3 = 3)

x[[6]]
#> Error in x[[6]] : subscript out of bounds

y["y3"] # Returns the name with its respective value
y[["y3"]] # Returns only the value itself

y["y5"]
#> <NA> 
#>  NA 
```

2.  What would pepper[[1]][1] be? What about pepper[[1]][[1]]?

```{r Pepper}
pepper <- list(
  packet1 = 1:3, 
  packet2 = "a string", 
  packet3 = pi, 
  packet4 = list(-1, -5)
)

pepper[[1]][1]
# pepper[[1]] extracts a single component from the list (the first one), so pepper[[1]][1] will return the first value from that single component (It may be a vector, or a single element for example)

pepper[[1]][[1]]
# This effectively performs the exact same as the above, its just more robust as if the single component we extracted from pepper[[1]] is a list, then pepper[[1]][[1]] will extract a single component from that respective subset list (the first one)

pepper2 <- list(
  packet1 = list(1:3), 
  packet2 = "a string"
)

pepper2[[1]][1]
pepper[[1]][[1]]
```
