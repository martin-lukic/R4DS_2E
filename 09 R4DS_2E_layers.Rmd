## Layers - Aesthetic mappings

1.  Create a scatterplot of hwy vs. displ where the points are pink filled in triangles.

```{r Pink triangles}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(colour = "pink", shape = 17)
```

2.  Why did the following code not result in a plot with blue points?

```{r Not blue?}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
# When color is set within an `aes()`, it is attempting a variable mapping to determine the appearence. So in the above example, `color = "blue"` is mapping the color of each variable based off the "variable", "blue". (Similar to how color = class works. Of course "blue" is not really a variable. It is a single value. Class has a bunch of different values in which the color aesthetic can map to)
```

3.  What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)

```{r Stroke aesthetic}
# Looking at an example from the documentation:

# For shapes that have a border (like 21), you can colour the inside and
# outside separately. Use the stroke aesthetic to modify the width of the
# border
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "black", fill = "white", size = 5, stroke = 5)
```

4.  What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(color = displ \< 5)? Note, you'll also need to specify x and y.

```{r Non-variable name mapping}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5)) + 
  geom_point()
# The following inequality `displ < 5` is either TRUE or FALSE. Thus this is a dichotomous mapping.
```

## Layers - Geometric objects

1.  What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? An area chart?

```{r Which geom?}
# geom_line() can be used to make a line graph with variables that make sense (time on x axis, some numeric quantity of y axis). Or we can use geom_smooth to create a "line chart" that is the line of best fit through all data points
ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy, displ)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy, class)) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) +
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy)) +
  geom_density()
```

2.  Earlier in this chapter we used show.legend without explaining it:

What does show.legend = FALSE do here? What happens if you remove it? Why do you think we used it earlier?

```{r Show.legend}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = drv), show.legend = FALSE)
# It won't show the legend describing which color maps to which drv value from our data. If we remove it, the legend will show (as show.legend is TRUE by default). It was removed earlier likely for space reasons (We can see our graph abit better now). Most of the time, removal of a legend is due to the fact that each line is obvious and we don't need to explicity have a legend to make sense of the plot.
```

3.  What does the se argument to geom_smooth() do?

```{r se argument}
# By default se = TRUE, which means a 95% confidence interval will be added around our line of best fits.
```

4.  Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs. Note that wherever a categorical variable is used in the plot, it's drv.

```{r Plot 1}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-2.png)

```{r Plot 2}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = drv), se = FALSE)
```

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-3.png)

```{r Plot 3}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

```{r Plot 4}

```

```{r Plot 5}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv), se = FALSE)
```

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-6.png)

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/layers_files/figure-html/fig-shapes-1.png)

```{r Plot 6}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, fill = drv)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3, colour = "white", stroke = 3)
# Shapes 21-24 have a border of colour and are filled with fill.
```

## Layers - Facets

1.  What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?

```{r Continous variable facet}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = depth, y = price)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~carat)
# It appears facet_wrap doesn't care if you use a continuous variable and forcefully wraps it anyway
```

2.  What do the empty cells in the plot above with facet_grid(drv \~ cyl) mean? Run the following code. How do they relate to the resulting plot?

```{r Related results}
# The above code mentioned is as follows:
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl, scales = "free_y")
# The empty celss tells us there are no data points for certain drv and cyl combinations. For example, in the dataset there are no 5 cylinder 4 wheel drive vehicles.

# Related plot:
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
# We see a similar result here. No points for 5 cylinder 4 wheel drive, etc. facet wrap makes this result, arguably easier to see.
```

3.  What plots does the following code make? What does . do?

```{r What does . do?}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

# The . in this context appears to be a placeholder for whether we want our faceted variable (such as drv and cylinder) to be faceted by rows or columns
```

4.  Take the first faceted plot in this section:

ggplot(mpg) + geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + facet_wrap(\~ class, nrow = 2)

What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the color aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?

```{r Advantages/Disadvantages of faceting}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
# Some advantages over coloring are that it is easier to separate between each class of vehicle. This advantage is even more obvious with a larger dataset where looking for differences between colours will be difficult (And the legend even bigger).
# Some disadvantages are since they aren't all on the same plot, differences between each class of vehicles, datawise, is harder to distinguish. Adding to this point, as each subplot is forced to be more compact, it is harder to see any relationships in the data. This disadvantage is amplied with larger datasets.
```

5.  Read ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn't facet_grid() have nrow and ncol arguments?

```{r Facet Wrap documentation}
# nrow and ncol are self-explanatory. Other arguments are things like `scales` which are related to the x & y axis. The `dir` argument defines how each subplot is added to the overall plot. For example "h" will add subplots horizontally (Left to right), while "v" adds them vertically (Top to bottom). This is easier to see with an example below:

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, dir = "h")

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, dir = "v")

# `facet_grid()` doesn't have nrow and ncol arguments since the two variables we choose within facet_grid will define the number of rows and number of columns. For example if we have a row variable with two possible values, and a column variable with three possible values, it will produce an overall plot with 6 subplots (2 x 3 = 6), with 2 rows and 3 columns. It cannot take imposed nrow and ncol arguments as this breaks the pairings between the x axis and y axis.
```

6.  Which of the following plots makes it easier to compare engine size (displ) across cars with different drive trains? What does this say about when to place a faceting variable across rows or columns?

```{r Which plot is better?}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(. ~ drv)

# I would argue the first, since engine size, the primary focus of our plot, is easier to compare between different drive trains due to them all using the same x axis, unlike the second plot which uses the same y axis but not the same x axis. The width of each bin is easier to see as well.
# Care should be taken to consider whether the most important variable we want to compare between facets, (in this case its displ) should be using only a singular axis (preferred) rather than multiple of the same axes.
```

7.  Recreate the following plot using facet_wrap() instead of facet_grid(). How do the positions of the facet labels change?

```{r Facet Grid to Facet Wrap}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~drv, dir = "v", strip.position = "right")
```

## Layers - Statistical Transformations

1.  What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()? How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?

```{r Stat Summary default geom}
# The default geom is geom_pointrange. (It is called "pointrange" only in the documentation since its stripped of the geom prefix)

ggplot(diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
  )

ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_pointrange(
    aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    stat = "summary",
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
  )
```

2.  What does geom_col() do? How is it different from geom_bar()?

```{r Geom Column}
# geom_bar() makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group. If you want the heights of the bars to represent values in the data, use geom_col() instead. geom_bar() uses stat_count() by default: it counts the number of cases at each x position. geom_col() uses stat_identity(): it leaves the data as is. Here are some examples:

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) + 
  geom_bar()

diamonds_plus <- diamonds |> 
  mutate(
    med_depth = median(depth, na.rm = TRUE),
    .by = cut
  ) |> 
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    .by = c(cut, med_depth)
  )

ggplot(diamonds_plus, aes(cut, med_depth)) +
geom_col()

df <- data.frame(trt = c("a", "b", "c"), outcome = c(2.3, 1.9, 3.2))
ggplot(df, aes(trt, outcome)) +
  geom_col()
```

3.  Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common? (Hint: Read through the documentation.)

```{r Geom and stat pairs}
# `geom_bar`,  with `stat = "count"`. `geom_hist`, `geom_freqpoly` with `stat = "bin"` etc. The geoms uses a relevant stat based off what data is generally being supplied to each geom. So for example we usually use geom_bar if we have discrete data which is best fit for stat = "count". Similar argument for geom_hist & geom_freqpoly since they are supplied continous data they use stat = "bin" instead.
```

4.  What variables does stat_smooth() compute? What arguments control its behavior?

```{r Stat Smooth}
# stat_smooth() provides the following variables, some of which depend on the orientation:
# after_stat(y) or after_stat(x)
# Predicted value.
# 
# after_stat(ymin) or after_stat(xmin)
# Lower pointwise confidence interval around the mean.
# 
# after_stat(ymax) or after_stat(xmax)
# Upper pointwise confidence interval around the mean.
# 
# after_stat(se)
# Standard error.


# Some of the arguments that control its behaviour are the following:
# method = NULL,
# formula = NULL,
# se = TRUE,
# n = 80,
# span = 0.75,
# fullrange = FALSE,
# level = 0.95,
# method.args = list(),
# na.rm = FALSE,
# orientation = NA,
# show.legend = NA,
# inherit.aes = TRUE
```

5.  In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other words, what is the problem with these two graphs?

```{r}
# after_stat is an expression using the variables calculated by the stat. So in this case since we are using `geom_bar` it will calculate respective proportions based off `stat_count`.
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) + 
  geom_bar()

# The bars are not grouped together because the group aesthetic is not set. As a result, each bar is treated as an individual entity, and the heights of the bars represent the proportion of each category within its own group. Since there is no grouping, the proportions are calculated independently for each bar, which leads to incorrect proportions being displayed, which is whatever the highest prop value is as its only comparing proportion values with itself. (Value of 1 for first plot, 7 for second plot)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(prop))) + 
  geom_bar()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = after_stat(prop))) + 
  geom_bar()
```

## Layers - Position adjustments

1. What is the problem with the following plot? How could you improve it?

```{r Improve the plot}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
# There might be overlapping points which are possibly overlapping certain interesting information about our data. Lets add some randomness to our points

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_jitter()
# As we can see this is a big improvement. There are clearly a lot more points towards the lower end of cty and hwy but not for the higher end. More care should be taken when analysing trends beyond combined cty and hwy values of (25, 30) for example
```

2. What, if anything, is the difference between the two plots? Why?

```{r Different plots?}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(position = "identity")
# In terms of the plots, visually there is no difference between either of them. However, adding the argument `position = "identity"` might be good code practice when making plots which involve overlapping data to inform the user running the code.
```

3. What parameters to geom_jitter() control the amount of jittering?

```{r More jitter}
# width and height control the amount of jitter. From the documentation:

# width, height:	
# Amount of vertical and horizontal jitter. The jitter is added in both positive and negative directions, so the total spread is twice the value specified here.
# If omitted, defaults to 40% of the resolution of the data: this means the jitter values will occupy 80% of the implied bins. Categorical data is aligned on the integers, so a width or height of 0.5 will spread the data so it's not possible to see the distinction between the categories.

# Lets see these arguments in action with some examples:

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_jitter()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 1)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_jitter(height = 1)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.5, height = 2)
```

4. Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().

```{r Geom Jitter vs. Geom Count}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_count()

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_jitter()

# `geom_count()` creates a legend displaying a rough estimate of how much overlapping we have on particular points. This can also be useful to visually identify how much overlapping we have at each point without sacrificing the accuracy of where the points should be displayed unlike with `geom_jitter()`. However with plots where data points are very close together, I imagine geom_count is not as good as there could be a lot of overlap between points, again obscuring overlapping of the data. Also since geom_count creates "buckets" of data (In the above example we have n = 2.5, 5, etc.), if there are many different "buckets" it can get a bit overwhelming visually.
```

5. What’s the default position adjustment for geom_boxplot()? Create a visualization of the mpg dataset that demonstrates it.

```{r Position of Geom Boxplot}
# Default position is "dodge2"
ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(colour = drv))
# So each boxplot relating class, hwy and their respective drv is automatically shown close to each other, as is the expected behaviour of position adjustment "dodge"
```

## Layers - Coordinate systems

1. Turn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using coord_polar().

```{r Stacked bar chart to polar}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = class)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  coord_polar()
```

2. What’s the difference between coord_quickmap() and coord_map()?

```{r Coordinate Quickmap vs. Coordinate Map}
nz <- map_data("nz")

ggplot(nz, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "black")

ggplot(nz, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "black") +
  coord_quickmap()

# Without looking at any documentation, at first glance `coord_quickmap()` appears to have a much more accurate aspect ratio which represents New Zealand much better.
# coord_map() projects a portion of the earth, which is approximately spherical, onto a flat 2D plane using any projection defined by the mapproj package. Map projections do not, in general, preserve straight lines, so this requires considerable computation. coord_quickmap() is a quick approximation that does preserve straight lines. It works best for smaller areas closer to the equator.
```

3. What does the following plot tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()

# As city miles per gallon goes up, highway miles per gallon also increases
# `coord_fixed()` is important as it forces a better specified ratio between the x-axis and y-axis. The ratio is 1:1 (each unit increase in the x-axis is the same distance as each unit increase in the y-axis). This gives us a much better representation of the relationship between cty and hwy
# `geom_abline()` adds a diagonal line through the plot which goes through the origin point. This helps us see that as each unit increase in cty there is a higher proportionate increase in hwy (as all data points are above the diagonal)
```
