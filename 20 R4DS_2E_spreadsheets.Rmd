## Spreadsheets - Excel

1. In an Excel file, create the following dataset and save it as survey.xlsx.(Its in the folder "data")
Then, read it into R, with survey_id as a character variable and n_pets as a numerical variable.
![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/screenshots/import-spreadsheets-survey.png)

```{r Reading excel file}
survey <- read_excel(
  "data/survey.xlsx",
  col_types = c("text", "numeric")
  )
survey
# We can see some issues. When changing a number to text we get an unnecessary floating point "number" of 1.0, 2.0 etc. `n_pets` also mixes text with numbers and there is an N/A value followed by an empty cell which I imagine also should be considered a missing value. Lets fix a few things up.

survey <- read_excel(
  "data/survey.xlsx",
  na = c("", "N/A"),
  col_types = c("text", "text")
  )
survey

survey <- survey |>
  mutate(
    n_pets = if_else(n_pets == "two", "2", n_pets),
    n_pets = parse_number(n_pets),
    survey_id = str_replace(survey_id, "\\.0", "")
  )
survey
```

2. In another Excel file, create the following dataset and save it as roster.xlsx. (Again in the folder "data")
![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/screenshots/import-spreadsheets-roster.png)
Then, read it into R. The resulting data frame should be called roster and should look like the following.

#> # A tibble: 12 × 3
#>    group subgroup    id
#>    <dbl> <chr>    <dbl>
#>  1     1 A            1
#>  2     1 A            2
#>  3     1 A            3
#>  4     1 B            4
#>  5     1 B            5
#>  6     1 B            6
#>  7     1 B            7
#>  8     2 A            8
#>  9     2 A            9
#> 10     2 B           10
#> 11     2 B           11
#> 12     2 B           12

```{r Reading another excel file!}
roster <- read_excel(
  "data/roster.xlsx",
  col_types = c("numeric", "text", "numeric")
  )
roster <- roster |> 
  fill(c(group, subgroup), .direction = "down")
# This was seen in a previous chapter
```

3. In a new Excel file, create the following dataset and save it as sales.xlsx. (Its in "data" folder)
![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/screenshots/import-spreadsheets-sales.png)

a. a. Read sales.xlsx in and save as sales. The data frame should look like the following, with id and n as column names and with 9 rows.

#> # A tibble: 9 × 2
#>   id      n    
#>   <chr>   <chr>
#> 1 Brand 1 n    
#> 2 1234    8    
#> 3 8721    2    
#> 4 1822    3    
#> 5 Brand 2 n    
#> 6 3333    1    
#> 7 2156    3    
#> 8 3987    6    
#> 9 3216    5

```{r Reading sales data p1}
sales <- read_excel(
  "data/sales.xlsx",
  col_names = c("id", "n"),
  skip = 4,
  col_types = c("text", "text")
  )
sales
```

b. Modify sales further to get it into the following tidy format with three columns (brand, id, and n) and 7 rows of data. Note that id and n are numeric, brand is a character variable.

#> # A tibble: 7 × 3
#>   brand      id     n
#>   <chr>   <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1 Brand 1  1234     8
#> 2 Brand 1  8721     2
#> 3 Brand 1  1822     3
#> 4 Brand 2  3333     1
#> 5 Brand 2  2156     3
#> 6 Brand 2  3987     6
#> 7 Brand 2  3216     5

```{r Reading sales data p2}
sales |> 
  slice(-c(1, 5)) |> 
  mutate(
    brand = rep(c("Brand 1", "Brand 2"), c(3, 4)),
    id = as.numeric(id),
    n = as.numeric(n)
    ) |> 
  relocate(brand)
```

4. Recreate the bake_sale data frame, write it out to an Excel file using the write.xlsx() function from the openxlsx package.

```{r Recreating the bake sale dataframe}
bake_sale <- tibble(
  item     = factor(c("brownie", "cupcake", "cookie")),
  quantity = c(10, 5, 8)
)

bake_sale

write_xlsx(bake_sale, path = "data/bake-sale.xlsx")
```

5. In Chapter 7 you learned about the janitor::clean_names() function to turn column names into snake case. Read the students.xlsx file that we introduced earlier in this section and use this function to “clean” the column names.

```{r Janitor work}
students <- read_excel("data/students.xlsx")

students <- students |> 
  janitor::clean_names()

students
```

6. What happens if you try to read in a file with .xlsx extension with read_xls()?

```{r Reading .xlsx file with read_xls}
students <- read_xls("data/students.xlsx")
# We get an error saying that read_xls was unable to open the file
```

## Spreadsheets - Google Sheets

Since these questions involve some sort of authentication via a google email, I'm going to pass on doing these questions for the time being.

1. Read the students dataset from earlier in the chapter from Excel and also from Google Sheets, with no additional arguments supplied to the read_excel() and read_sheet() functions. Are the resulting data frames in R exactly the same? If not, how are they different?

```{r Differences in Excel and Google Sheets}
students_excel <- read_xlsx("data/students.xlsx")
students_sheet_id <- "1V1nPp1tzOuutXFLb3G9Eyxi3qxeEhnOXUzL5_BcCQ0w"
students_google <- read_sheet(students_sheet_id)
```
