This is a repository giving solutions to the second edition of R for Data Science which can be found online for free here -> https://r4ds.hadley.nz/

The solutions for each chapter is titled with its respective chapter number and name in a RMarkdown document. If you can't find a specific chapter number, it means it didn't have any exercises.

Some of the solutions within each RMarkdown file may be incomplete, in which case I suggest looking through the following link -> https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/ <- which details the solutions for the first edition of the book (Note that alot of the first edition questions appear in the second edition so its a very useful resource, in fact many of the solutions found in this repo may be adapted from this resource)

It may also be worth keeping an eye on the following link -> https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/r4ds-solutions/ <- which is supposed to give solutions to the second edition but is currently WIP at the time of writing
