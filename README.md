# R for Data Science (Second Edition) Exercise Solutions

This repository contains solutions to exercises from the second edition of the book *R for Data Science*, which is available online for free [here](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

## Structure

The solutions for each chapter are organized into separate RMarkdown documents. Each file is titled with the respective chapter number and name.

If a specific chapter number is missing, it indicates that the chapter does not contain exercises.

## Completeness

Please note that some solutions within each RMarkdown file may be incomplete. In such cases, consider referring to the [solutions provided here](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/), which detail solutions for the first edition of the book. Many exercises from the first edition are included in the second edition, making this resource valuable for completing solutions. (Many of the solutions in this repo would have been adapted from this resource)
