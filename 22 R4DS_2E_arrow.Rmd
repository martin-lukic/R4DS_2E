## Arrow - Using dplyr with arrow

1. Figure out the most popular book each year.

Given that the dataset we'll be looking at is 9GB, I think I'm going to skip over these questions

```{r Most popular book each year}

```

2. Which author has the most books in the Seattle library system?

```{r Most common Seattle library author}

```

3. How has checkouts of books vs ebooks changed over the last 10 years?

```{r Books vs Ebooks overtime}

```
